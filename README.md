# anomalydetection_in_ethereum
#Overview
This project focuses on identifying anomalies in the Ethereum blockchain network using machine learning techniques. Anomalies could represent fraudulent transactions, network attacks, or irregular blockchain activity. The project leverages transaction data and applies anomaly detection algorithms to detect unusual patterns.

# Project Structure
Notebook: anamoly_detection_in_etherum.ipynb

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering

Visualization of transaction patterns

Application of anomaly detection models

Evaluation of results

#Requirements
Before running the notebook, install the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
#Additional libraries (based on notebook content):

plotly (for interactive visualizations)

imbalanced-learn (if oversampling/undersampling techniques are used)

#Key Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of distributions and correlations.

#Machine Learning Algorithms:

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

#Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC Curve (if applicable)

#How to Run
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Install the required packages.

Open the Jupyter Notebook.

Run all the cells in order to preprocess the data, train models, and analyze results.

Results
Identification of anomalous Ethereum transactions.

Insights into transaction behaviors deviating from the normal pattern.

Model comparisons based on performance metrics.

#Future Work
Extend to real-time anomaly detection using streaming data.

Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders).

Integration with Ethereum smart contracts for proactive fraud alerts.
